# Rainfall_Analysis_AWS-and-Snowflake_PowerBI-project
 1. Project Title:
    Rainfall Analysis with AWS & Snowflake
 
 2. Problem Statement / Objective:
    This Powerbi Dashboard shows the user Rainfall/Temperature/Humidity/Yield Analysis 
    More specifically user can filter out the particular crops and their prorductivity with particular temperature and with seasons as well, making this report beneficial for the analysis.

 3. Data Sources:
    AWS S3 bucket - For storing rwa data
    Kaggle - Major Datasource
 
 4. Tools & Technologies Used:
    AWS S3 BUCKET - For storing raw data files.
    SNOWFLAKE - For quering , data cleaning, and setting up connection with AWS and working on the raw data.
    Data was pulled into powerBI via snowflake and further reports were created.
 
 5.Key Metrics & KPIs Tracked:
   a) AVG. Rainfall by Year 
   b) AVG. Rainfall by Location
   c) AVG. Rainfall by Season
   d) AVG. Rainfall by Crop
   e) AVG. Temparature by Year 
   f) AVG. Temperature by Location
   g) AVG. Temperature by Season
   h) AVG. Temperature by Crop
   i) AVG. Humidity by Year 
   j) AVG. Humidity by Location
   k) AVG. Humidity by Season
   l) AVG. Humidity by Crop
   m) AVG. Yield by Year 
   n) AVG. Yield by Location
   o) AVG. Yield by Season
